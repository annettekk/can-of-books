# Building CRUD apps with MongoDB 

## Overview - Can of Books App

### Process: Professional Pairing Practice:

**Logistical**  
1. What hours will you be available to communicate?  
Yaga - 9-17, and any time in the evening when needed
2. What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? 
Yaga - 9-17 - google meet/BOR, any time - Discord
3. How often will you take breaks?  
Yaga - as usual at the class 
4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?  
Yaga - reevaluate priorities
**Cooperative**  
1. Make a list of each parson’s strengths.  
|      Anna K       |     Yaga       |
|:---------------|:------------------|
|                | report/documentation & notes writting   |
|:---------------|:------------------|
|                | CSS
|----------------|-------------------|
|                | googling

2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?  

3. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?  
|      Anna K       |     Yaga       |
|:---------------|:------------------|
|                |    Raact
|:---------------|:------------------|
|                | server build

4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?  
Yaga -  keep communication flowing, be honest with progress 
**Conflict Resolution**
1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?  

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?  

3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

### Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

### Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

### Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

### Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

### Estimates
<!-- See below -->

### Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

## Time Estimates - For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:
Name of feature: ________________________________

Estimate of time needed to complete: _____

Start time: _____

Finish time: _____

Actual time needed to complete: _____

### Submission Instructions - day 1
1. Complete your Feature Tasks for the lab, according to the Trello cards.  

2. Create a PR back to the main branch of your repository, showing ALL your work, and merge it cleanly.  

3. On Canvas, submit a link to your PR. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
    - A link to the deployed version of your latest code.  
    - A link to your public Trello board.  
    - A question within the context of this lab assignment.  
    - An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment.  
    - How long you spent working on this assignment.
