   | Structure of the app      | googling                 |
   | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |

6. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
   We can devide tasks between each other utilizing the strengths as well as support ech aother to overcome weaknesses and errors.
7. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

   |:---------------|:------------------|
   |Front End | React |
   |:---------------|:------------------|
   |Back End | server build |

8. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?  
   Yaga - keep communication flowing, be honest with progress
   **Conflict Resolution**
9. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
   Revise the task and working plan
10. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    First of all talk about the issue and the revise what must be done, in what order and by whom.
11. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
